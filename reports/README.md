# Reports

This folder stores generated statistics, summaries, and analysis outputs.

Suggested naming patterns:
- `faces_<scene_name>_<timestamp>.txt` — mesh face counts
- `simplify_plan_<scene_name>_<timestamp>.txt` — planned vs target faces
- `uv_audit_<scene_name>_<timestamp>.csv` — UV checks (interpolation, counts)

You can place any ad-hoc report files here from CLI or custom scripts.
