# Material-Effect Baseline Experiment

This experiment line prepares the ConvertAsset vs NVIDIA baseline comparison
requested by the reviews. It starts from the existing GRScenes expanded30 stress
pool and labels samples by MDL material effects.

Sample-manifest entry point:

```bash
python paper/shared/evidence/experiments/08_material_effect_baseline/build_effect_sample_manifest.py
```

Default sample output:

```text
paper/shared/evidence/raw/material_effect_baseline/effect_sample_manifest.json
```

The manifest is a planning artifact. It does not contain NVIDIA baseline results
yet. It records the current GRScenes coverage and the missing effect bins that
must be filled with official/sample assets before full material-effect claims.

Current GRScenes coverage:

- 30 linked expanded30 stress samples
- 0 missing material model links
- covered: `opacity_transparency`, `emission`, `normal_bump`,
  `displacement_height`
- missing: `clearcoat`, `procedural_texture`

NVIDIA Asset Converter smoke entry point:

```bash
timeout 240 ./scripts/isaac_python.sh paper/shared/evidence/experiments/08_material_effect_baseline/run_nvidia_asset_converter_smoke.py
```

Default smoke output:

```text
paper/shared/evidence/raw/material_effect_baseline/nvidia_baseline_smoke_manifest.json
```

Current smoke result:

- 3 converter attempts succeeded
- 2 USD outputs are claimable baseline candidates:
  `usd_to_usd_preview` and `usd_to_usd_bake_flag`
- both claimable USD outputs have 4 `UsdPreviewSurface` shaders and 0 active
  MDL source-asset shaders

Next scripts should add:

- baseline conversion manifest;
- paired render manifest for original / ConvertAsset / NVIDIA;
- effect-grouped tables and qualitative failure panels.
