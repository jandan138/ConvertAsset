# Mesh Simplification (Python QEM Backend)

This section documents the pure-Python QEM (Quadric Error Metrics) mesh simplifier implemented in `convert_asset/mesh/simplify.py`.

- Overview: high-level goals and constraints
- Algorithm: how QEM is computed and applied
- CLI usage: commands and options
- Performance tips and limits
- Roadmap: potential enhancements
- Face counting: how face totals are computed from USD meshes
