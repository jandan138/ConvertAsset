# Architecture & Design

This section covers the system design, data flow, and core module analysis of the ConvertAsset project.

## Core Documentation
- [**Design Philosophy**](design.md): High-level design goals and decisions.
- [**Execution Flow**](flow.md): Step-by-step execution flow of the conversion pipeline.
- [**Modules**](modules.md): Detailed breakdown of Python modules and their responsibilities.
- [**Callstack Analysis**](callstack.md): Runtime call stack examples for debugging.
- [**Processor Details**](processor_details.md): Deep dive into the `processor.py` logic.

## Specific Features
- [**Orbit Camera Capture**](orbit_camera_capture.md): Architecture of the orbit camera capture system.
- [**AI Material Analysis**](ai_material_analysis.md): (Moved) Research on AI-based material representation.

## How to Read
1. Start with **Design** and **Flow** to get a high-level understanding.
